## Decision Guidelines

### When to Document

Document decisions that:
- Affect architecture or design
- Have significant trade-offs
- Might be questioned later
- Involve external dependencies
- Could be reversed but shouldn't be casual

### Don't Document

Skip documenting:
- Trivial implementation details
- Obvious choices
- Temporary decisions (use comments instead)

### Good Decision Entries

Include:
- Clear context (why was this needed?)
- The actual decision (not just discussion)
- Rationale (why this choice?)
- Alternatives (what else was considered?)
- Reversibility (can we change our mind?)
