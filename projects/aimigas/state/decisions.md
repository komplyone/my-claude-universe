## Decisions

### DEC-2025-001: Learning Laboratory Approach
**Date:** 2025-01-01
**Context:** Defining what Aimigas is
**Decision:** Position as experimental learning project, not traditional product
**Rationale:**
- Human-AI collaboration is evolving rapidly
- Better to learn by doing than theorize
- Patterns emerge from practical experience
**Alternatives Considered:**
- Build specific product: Too constrained
- Pure research: Too disconnected from practice
**Reversible:** Yes

### DEC-2025-002: KomplyOne Universe as Primary Output
**Date:** 2025-01-15
**Context:** Capturing collaboration patterns
**Decision:** The Universe workflow system is the main Aimigas deliverable
**Rationale:**
- Practical and immediately useful
- Demonstrates patterns in action
- Can evolve with learning
**Alternatives Considered:**
- Separate documentation: Less practical
- No formal output: Loses learnings
**Reversible:** Yes
