# Aimigas — Project Context

> Human-AI collaboration platform. Learning by doing.

---

## Overview

Aimigas (a play on "amigas" — friends in Spanish, with "AI") is an experimental project exploring human-AI collaboration patterns. Rather than building a specific product, it's about understanding and documenting effective ways to work with AI.

**Philosophy:** Learn by doing. The KomplyOne Universe itself is an Aimigas output — a practical system for human-AI collaboration developed through experience.

## Current State

**Status:** Active/Experimental

Aimigas is less a traditional product and more a learning laboratory. Insights from building Recoger and Velador with AI assistance are captured and refined into reusable patterns.

## Core Outputs

### KomplyOne Universe
The workflow system you're using right now is an Aimigas creation:
- Lazy context loading
- Structured state management
- Multi-tool handoffs
- Command patterns

### Collaboration Patterns
Documented approaches to human-AI work:
- "Claude proposes, human decides"
- Planning vs action mode separation
- Session continuity techniques
- Context budget management

### AI-First Design Principles
Guidelines for building products in an AI-first world:
- Machine-readable interfaces
- Structured output formats
- Context-aware responses
- Multi-agent compatibility

---

## Focus Areas

### 1. Workflow Patterns
How to structure work between humans and AI:
- Task decomposition
- Approval workflows
- Progress tracking
- Session management

### 2. Context Management
How to provide AI with the right context:
- Lazy loading strategies
- Token budget optimization
- Focus/scope boundaries
- State persistence

### 3. Multi-Tool Workflows
How to work across different AI tools:
- Handoff protocols
- Context packaging
- Return synchronization
- Tool selection guidance

### 4. AI-First Product Design
How to build products for human+AI users:
- API design for AI agents
- Documentation structure
- Interface patterns
- Accessibility for AI

## Relationship to Other Projects

Aimigas is meta — it's about *how* we build, not *what* we build:

| Project | Aimigas Role |
|---------|--------------|
| Recoger | Learning laboratory for patterns |
| Velador | Application of refined patterns |
| KomplyOne | Showcase of AI-first principles |

## What Claude Should Know

1. **Experimental nature:** Not a traditional product with roadmap
2. **Meta-level:** About the process, not the output
3. **Learning focus:** Prioritize insights over deliverables
4. **Documentation:** Capture patterns for reuse

---

## What Claude Should NOT Do

- Treat as a traditional product with hard deadlines
- Ignore insights in favor of "getting things done"
- Over-engineer before patterns are validated
- Forget to document learnings
