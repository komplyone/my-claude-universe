# Velador — Project Context

> GRC platform with implementation expertise. "Compliance done right, not just done."

---

## Overview

Velador is a GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) platform differentiated by combining software with implementation expertise. The name comes from Spanish "velador" meaning "night watchman, guardian" — reflecting its role in watching over compliance programs.

**Key Differentiation:**
- "Most GRC tools dumb down compliance into checkbox exercises. We think that's a disservice."
- "An ISMS that's just paperwork isn't protecting anyone."
- "Built by consultants who've seen what works—and what doesn't."

---

## Current State

**Status:** Concept/Planning

Velador is in the concept validation phase. Development will begin after Recoger reaches MVP and validates the market approach.

---

## Concept

### System + Services Model

Unlike pure-SaaS GRC tools, Velador combines:
1. **Platform:** Software for managing compliance programs
2. **Services:** Human/AI implementation support

This addresses the core problem: organizations buy GRC tools but struggle to implement them properly, resulting in "checkbox compliance" that doesn't actually improve security.

### Target Market

- SMBs pursuing ISO 27001, SOC 2, or similar certifications
- Companies that want compliance done right, not just done
- Organizations without dedicated compliance teams
- Security-conscious European companies

### Competitive Position

**Against Vanta/Drata/Secureframe:**
- We support real compliance, not just evidence automation
- Implementation expertise included
- EU-first infrastructure

**Against enterprise GRC (ServiceNow, OneTrust):**
- Right-sized for SMBs
- No enterprise sales games
- Fast time to value

---

## Relationship to Recoger

Velador and Recoger are complementary:
- **Recoger:** Collects device compliance evidence
- **Velador:** Manages the overall compliance program

Recoger can integrate with Velador as an evidence source, but both products can stand alone.

---

## Planned Features

### Phase 1: Core GRC
- Policy management
- Risk register
- Control mapping
- Evidence collection
- Audit preparation

### Phase 2: Frameworks
- ISO 27001 templates and guidance
- SOC 2 mapping
- GDPR compliance tracking
- Custom framework support

### Phase 3: Intelligence
- AI-assisted policy drafting
- Automated gap analysis
- Risk recommendations
- Compliance scoring

## What Claude Should Know

1. **Secondary priority:** Velador development starts after Recoger MVP
2. **Concept phase:** Focus on validation, not implementation
3. **Shared infrastructure:** Will use same EU-first stack as Recoger
4. **Brand connection:** Part of KomplyOne family with Recoger

---

## What Claude Should NOT Do

- Start implementation before concept is validated
- Prioritize Velador over Recoger
- Deviate from the "compliance done right" positioning
- Suggest generic checkbox-style compliance features
