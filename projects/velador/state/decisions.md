## Decisions

### DEC-2025-001: System + Services Model
**Date:** 2025-01-01
**Context:** Differentiating from pure-SaaS GRC tools
**Decision:** Combine platform software with implementation consulting
**Rationale:**
- GRC tools alone often lead to checkbox compliance
- Implementation expertise is the real value
- Creates sustainable competitive advantage
**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pure SaaS: Commoditized, race to bottom
- Pure consulting: Doesn't scale
**Reversible:** Partially

### DEC-2025-002: Secondary Priority to Recoger
**Date:** 2025-01-01
**Context:** Resource allocation between products
**Decision:** Velador development starts after Recoger MVP
**Rationale:**
- Recoger is more developed
- Simpler product to validate market
- Can inform Velador development
**Alternatives Considered:**
- Parallel development: Spreads resources too thin
- Velador first: More complex, slower validation
**Reversible:** Yes
