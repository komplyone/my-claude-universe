## Values

1. **Quality over speed** — We're building for the long term
2. **Transparency** — Honest about limitations and uncertainties
3. **User-centric** — Everything serves the end customer
4. **Simplicity** — Prefer simple solutions that work
5. **Compliance done right** — Real security value, not checkbox exercises

---

## Voice & Tone

**Professional but human.** We're experts who communicate clearly without jargon. We're confident but not arrogant. We acknowledge complexity while making things accessible.

**Direct and honest.** We say what we mean. We admit when we don't know something. We don't oversell or make promises we can't keep.

**Helpful and supportive.** We want customers to succeed. We explain the "why" not just the "what." We treat security as something that helps organizations, not burdens them.

---

## Target Market

**Primary:** Security-conscious European SMBs (10-500 employees)
- Companies without dedicated security teams
- Organizations pursuing compliance (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR)
- Teams that value "done right" over "done fast"

**Geographic Focus:** Europe (EU data residency is a feature, not constraint)

**Buyer Personas:**
- IT Manager responsible for security
- CTO/VP Engineering at growing startup
- Compliance Manager at regulated company
- Founder/CEO at security-conscious startup

---

## Competitive Differentiation

**Against incumbent GRC tools (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe):**
- We support "compliance done right" not checkbox exercises
- EU-first infrastructure and philosophy
- Transparent, simple pricing
- System + Services model (not just software)

**Against enterprise tools (ServiceNow, OneTrust):**
- Right-sized for SMBs
- No enterprise sales process or pricing games
- Fast time to value
- Human touch without enterprise overhead
